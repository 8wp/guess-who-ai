<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>This tool is a locally hosted Python script that uses on-device OCR (Optical Character Recognition) alongside the Discord gateway 
to enable one-time, trigger-based messaging. You define trigger-response pairs in the config file — for example, if the script 
detects a specific piece of text on your screen, it will immediately send the corresponding predefined response to the selected 
Discord channel. The script authenticates with your bot/user token and establishes a WebSocket connection to deliver 
the message instantly. All setup — including trigger text, response messages, and channel selection — is handled entirely 
through the config, making it a straightforward, end-to-end solution for automated OCR-driven responses without external 
hosting or services.</p>
